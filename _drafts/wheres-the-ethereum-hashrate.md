## Where's the Ethereum Hashrate?

Right there are a couple of facts:

- Global Ethereum Hashrate 140 TH
- Daily Payout ~ 1.6 mio USD (~ $50 mio USD month)

### Claims

- Bitmain E3 mass production
- Innosilicon A10 was only in testing
- Linzhi, no chip or machine at present
- Nvidia GPU
- AMD GPU
- Other hashrate sources, inconsequential (cpu, fpga)


### Pools

- What are the big Ethereum Pools?

### Question

- What is the global % breakdwon of hashrate control?
- What is the technology % breakdown of hashrate?
- How to measure this on an ongoing basis?

### Ideas

- Look at block rewards and trace back through to the pools to measure who has real hashpower.
