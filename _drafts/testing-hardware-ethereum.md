## The Crypto-natives

It is 10 years since the release of Bitcoin. The old timers pre-crypto from the Open Source era start to recognize some members of the crypto community as scammers and innovators, however, what we truly are witnessing are the "crypto-natives". These people were born into crypto and are simply living by the crypto ethos which is get resources in the most efficient way possible.

Currently the crypto-natives natural state is effected by an unforeseen invisible force, the crypto-winter. This has forced the crypto-natives into a cryto-dark age, a crypto-dark forest. The crypto-natives are forced into the crypto-caves.

What is needed to ward off the darkness and bring about the birth of a new era, is a crypto-enlightenment.

This crypto-enlightenment is sought. And, what comes with enlightenment is renaissance, a crypto-renaissance is coming.
