## Proof of Contributions (DRAFT)

- [Proof of Contribution Discussion](http://proofofcontribution.org) (unlaunched)
- Proof of Contribution coverage at Bitoin Scaling at Stanford

- Proof of Work Algorithm = Chip Specification
- Why do random WORK with ProgPOW or other changes, Monero, etc, when can do work that helps or scales a network.
- The work could also be something like protein folding, SETI, or BOINC.
- Cryptocurrency software developers when writing software algorithms are defining a specification for chip makers.
- Once this power is realized, then Crypto software writers can realize each ALGORITHM change means a hardware change.
- Crypto software developers have lots of power. Why use it to make more waste with energy or tons of hardware changes.
- Why do ASIC Resistance when can make ASIC Assistance?
- Fear is not a good teacher.
- While others do ASIC Resistance and some ASIC Protests, Proof of Contribution is about ASIC Assistance.
- Hardware scaling and power is unstoppable, as is the capital investments connected to hardware scaling.
- To go against hardware is to go backwards or into a software seclusion.
